# BusinessDirectory

A web-based business directory that allows users to search, filter, and manage listings for local businesses.

## Google Maps integration

The add-business form supports Google Places Autocomplete to make it easier to capture business names and addresses. To enable it youâ€™ll need a [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) key.

1. Create or locate your Maps API key in the Google Cloud console and ensure the **Places API** is enabled.
2. Update the `window.googleMapsConfig` object in [`index.html`](index.html) with your key:

   ```html
   <script>
     window.googleMapsConfig = {
       apiKey: "YOUR_REAL_API_KEY",
     };
   </script>
   ```

If no key (or the placeholder value) is provided, the directory will continue to work â€” youâ€™ll just miss out on the autocomplete assistance.
